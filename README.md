# KaggleHousePrice

I implemented EDA on the dataset and build a stacked meta model to make predictions.

All the information and dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques

This code basicly follows the steps of https://www.kaggle.com/code/serigne/stacked-regressions-top-4-on-leaderboard by SERIGNE.
